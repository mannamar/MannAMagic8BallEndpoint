# MannAMagic8BallEndpoint

Project Description:
A ReverseIt application that will take in a string as user input and output its reverse

Instructions:
1. Download the files and put them in their own folder, open the folder in VS Code, and start debugging (F5)
2. Navigate to "http://localhost:5193/Magic8Ball" for the default output of a random answer (you may need to change the port if it's different on your system > see debug console)
3. Append URL with any question of your choosing such as "http://localhost:5193/Magic8Ball/Will%20I%20win%20the%20lottery%20tomorrow" for a customized response (Spaces should be replaced with %20)
4. Enjoy!

Peer reviewed by Jacob Dekok: The program runs perfectly and I found no errors. I like how he added two routes the program could take, one if you don't want to type out the question and the other will output your question along with an answer from the magic 8. The code is very organized and I see he used some of the things we learned in todays lecture(10/27/2022) like putting the route with the [HttpGet("...")]
